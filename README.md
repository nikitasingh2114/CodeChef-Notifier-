# CodeChef-Notifier-
CodeChef Notifier is a web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that displays upcoming contests on CodeChef. The app uses CodeChef's API to retrieve contest data and displays it in a clear, easy-to-read format. This project demonstrates how to use APIs and JavaScript to create a useful application.
